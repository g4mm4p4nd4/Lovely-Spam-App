extend urllib2 to enable uploading files using multipart/form-data

I was looking for something to make me able to upload files to my photo web site (http://gallery.menalto.com/).
Inspired by http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/146306

Example:

import urllib2_file
import urllib2

data = { 'foo':         'bar',
         'form_name':    open("/lib/libc.so.1")
        }
(send something like: 'Content-Disposition: form-data; name="form_name"; filename="form_name";' )

Or if you want to specify a different filename:
data = { 'foo':         'bar',
         'form_name':   { 'fd':          open('/lib/libresolv.so.2',
                          'filename':    'libresolv.so'}
        }
(send something like: 'Content-Disposition: form-data; name="form_name"; filename="libresolv.so";' )

u = urllib2.urlopen('http://site.com/path/upload.php', data)


THANKS to:
- bug fix: kosh @T aesaeion.com
- HTTPS support : Ryan Grow <ryangrow @T yahoo.com>
 - upload is now done with chunks (Adam Ambrose)
 - UTF-8 filenames are now allowed (Eli Golovinsky)
 - File object is no more mandatory, Object only needs to have seek() read() attributes (Eli Golovinsky)
 - StringIO workaround (Laurent Coustet), does not work with cStringIO

 Also modified by Adam Ambrose (aambrose @T pacbell.net) to write data in
chunks (hardcoded to CHUNK_SIZE for now), so the entire contents of the file
don't need to be kept in memory.
